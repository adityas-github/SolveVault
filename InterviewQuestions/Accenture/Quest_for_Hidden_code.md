# Mystical Strings and Encoded Secrets

In a remote village, there existed two mystical strings S1 and S2. In these strings was hidden a secret encoded in their characters. Your task is to find and return an integer value representing the encoded secret of the strings by finding the sum of the ASCII values of the characters in the longest common substring between these two strings.

Return 0 if there is no common substring.

## Notes:

- Strings S1 and S2 contain English alphabets in lower case only.
- If there are multiple longest common substrings, then return the ASCII sum of the substring that occurs first.

## Input Specification:

- input1: A string value S1
- input2: A string value S2

## Output Specification:

Return an integer value representing the encoded secret of the strings by finding the sum of the ASCII values of the characters in the longest common substring between these two strings.

## Solution
